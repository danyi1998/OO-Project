This project involves the registration of students, programs and their courses, and also allows students to register for courses. It is meant to model a university student and course registration system. 

It consists of 5 entity classes: Students, Student, Programs, Program, and Course, and 1 control class: Control.
The 'Students' class instantiates 'Student' objects, the 'Programs' class instantiates 'Program' objects and the 'Program' class instantiates 'Course' objects. A 'Student' object can register for a 'Course'.
